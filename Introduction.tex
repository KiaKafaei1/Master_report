\section{Introduction}
Robots has been a thing for the future for a very long time being a thing only seen depicted in hollywood movies with not much basis in reality. This fact is slowly changing and now we are seeing robots that are slowly looking like the hollywood movies. The spot robot from boston dynamics is the newest example of this. The robot is the first of its kind to be able to walk around alone and has many uses. One example of its use is in the construction industry. 
Which leads us to the challenge being solved for in this project. 





\section*{Motivation}
Why is it interesting?
The project is being worked on in collaboration with Dalux which is a software company that makes BIM models (Building information modelling). At the moment Dalux has to hire an expensive arcitect to walk around the construction site to check up on that everything is going according to plan and that there aren’t any errors. If this process could be automated such that a robot could walk around a construction instead and send the data directly to Dalux’ software, that would be of great benefit for Dalux. 


\section{Abstract}
Første problem. En bim model ind og finde fra a til b.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make a simulation of a particle moving from one point to another
    \item Make the simulation include walls and obstacles
    \item Transfer walls from a real BIM model onto simulation
    \item Make a maximum coverage algorithm to find specific nodes that are most optimal for point clouds
    \item Find an optimal route for the particle to move between maximum coverage nodes.
    \item Start testing on the robot and include 
\end{itemize}



\section*{Objective}
The objective of this project is to program the spot robot from Boston Dynamics
to move around construction sites. The robot should be able to walk around the entire construction site on its own and should – while walking – take pictures (or/and point scans) of the construction site. The purpose of this is that after the construction workers have done their day of work the spot robot should wake up at night and walk around the construction site to see if everything is going according to plan and if all deadlines and milestones are met.

What should be done?
Boundaries: what can I probably not do?
Risk analysis: What parts of the project are going to be difficult
