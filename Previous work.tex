\section{Previous work}
\subsection{Wayfinding}
In the paper Wayfinding (insert reference) which is a DTU project in collaboration with Dalux, the goal was to do a pathfinding for a worker in a building. This is similar to what will be done in this thesis and therefore a lot of the same groundwork is done. The dataset is also the same, which makes it easy to translate the results and compare. Even though there was no access to the source code they used to generate their algorithms the report gave good inspiration to what should be done and it also worked as a guide for me to get started. I will be using this report as a reference thorughout this thesis.
