Describe the tools youâ€™ve used

\subsection{My process}
\begin{itemize}
    \item I spent a week or 2 to create the floor plan in python. I then got stuck with the doors since they do not match in any sort of way.
    \item I moved on to experimenting with unity. Making a grid system that could implement A*.
    \item I spent time researching whether to use the grid system or the graph/polygonal system.
    \item I went back to trying to find the best software for simulation in the future also.
    \item Now I am back to implementing the algorithm in python 2D like they did in the 3 week report, before doing the simulation in unity.
    \item I implemented the TSP solution to the problem. 
    \item I visited the Spot robot in Odense
\end{itemize}


\subsection{General questions to answer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How to get around the building
    \item How to get from room to room/around the building in an appropriate way?
\end{itemize}
